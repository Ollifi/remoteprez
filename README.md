A Google Chrome extension to remotely control an HTML5 presentation.

Currently, the following presentations are supported:

Roadmap
---

- [Guess the engine used](https://github.com/Ralt/remoteprez/issues/1)
- Design the logo of the extension
- Design the control page
- [Add a QRCode to ease the mobile usage](https://github.com/Ralt/remoteprez/issues/2)
- [Use the latest version of manifest.json](https://github.com/Ralt/remoteprez/issues/3)

Once this will be done, the extension will be added to the Chrome Web Store.
