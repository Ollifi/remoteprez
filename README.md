Introduction
---

A Google Chrome extension to remotely control an HTML5 presentation.

Currently, the following presentations are supported:

- [Reveal.js][1]
- [impress.js][2]
- [html5slides][3]

Roadmap
---

- Design the extension usage (using a `prompt()` is quite ugly)
- Design the logo of the extension
- Design the control page
- Add a middle button
- Add a QRCode to ease the mobile usage
- Use the latest version of manifest.json

Once this will be done, the extension will be added to the Chrome Web Store.
